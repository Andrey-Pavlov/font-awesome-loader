Yes, we need some tests!

## Testing
Until then, please test out your changes in the [shakacode/bootstrap-loader](https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader) project.

Look for the "font-awesome-loader" in the
[examples/basic/package.json](https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader/blob/master/examples/basic/package.json) file. Test out
your changes here.

When you submit a PR, please write down what you did to manually test this.

## Releasing

I use release-it! (`npm i -g release-it`)

```
release-it 1.0.0
```

or for a beta:

```
release-it 0.0.1-beta.1
```
